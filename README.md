# Optical control for Tello drone
Using Damià Fuentes Escoté's library (https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy) as a base.

For my bachelor thesis I created a control system for the Tello with the inbuilt, monocular camera: autonomous navigation and data collection.

Tested with Python 3.7 and OpenCV 4.1.0. and 7x7 ArUco dictionary.
